TPySelector example
===================
Granted, this example does not make a lot of sense from a physical point of few but demonstrates how to run a local analysis written in python and using the TPySelector class.
Unfortunately, I cannot make the root files with the data available so on cannot run this but I hope that the code is clear enough to see what is going on and trust me, it works!
